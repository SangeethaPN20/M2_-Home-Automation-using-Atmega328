# ABSTRACT
Home automation involves intoducing a degree of computerized or automatic control to certain electrical and electronic systems in a building. These include lighting, temperature control, etc. This project demonstrates a simple home automation system which contains a remote mobile host controller and several client modules. The client modules communicate with the hist controller through a wireless device such as a bluetooth enabled mobile phone, in this case , an android based smart phone.
# Requirements
# Introduction
A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central smart home hub (sometimes called a "gateway"). The user interface for control of the system uses either wall-mounted terminals, tablet or desktop computers, a mobile phone application, or a Web interface that may also be accessible off-site through the InternetWhile there are many competing vendors, there are increasing efforts towards open source systems. However, there are issues with the current state of home automation including a lack of standardized security measures and deprecation of older devices without backwards compatibilityHome automation has high potential for sharing data between family members or trusted individuals for personal security and could lead to energy saving measures with a positive environmental impact in the future.

# OBJECTIVE
Home Automation is a term used to describe the working together of all household amenities and appliances. For example, a centrally-controlled LCD panel can have the capability to control everything from heating, air conditioning, security systems, audio systems, video systems, lighting, kitchen appliances, and home theatre installations.
